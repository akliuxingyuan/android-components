 * @param maxBytes The largest image, in bytes, that will be read from the stream. Callers pick this, since only they
 *   know what their source is worth reading; a stream over it is rejected outright rather than truncated, and one at or
 *   below it costs a small multiple of its size to buffer before the decode. A limit of zero or less reads nothing.
 * @return the decoded [Bitmap], or null if the stream could not be read or decoded, or carried more than [maxBytes].
