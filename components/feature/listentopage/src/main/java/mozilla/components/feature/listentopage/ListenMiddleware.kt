/**
 * [Middleware] that extracts the article a listening session reads out, synthesizes it and plays it.
 *
 * @property contentProvider Provides the article text and language for a tab.
 * @property synthesizerProvider Builds the speech engine. A provider rather than an instance for two reasons: building
 *   one binds the platform engine over IPC, which must not happen on the caller's thread, and [SpeechSynthesizer.close]
 *   is terminal, so a session that closes its engine needs a way to get another one.
 * @property audioCache Holds the audio files. It is emptied when the session stops.
 * @property playbackController Plays the audio file. It is used instead of the player directly, because only playback
 *   commanded through the media session keeps the audio alive in the background and shows the notification.
 * @property scope The [CoroutineScope] the extraction, the synthesis and the playback commands run in. It has to
 *   dispatch on one thread: the session fields below are read from `invoke`, which the store runs on whichever thread
 *   dispatched, and written from this scope.
 * @property ioDispatcher The dispatcher that binding the engine, asking it for its voices, and closing it run on.
